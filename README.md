# DD Easter Egg Collection [deployed](https://liazapciroiu.github.io/ddEasterEggCollection/)
This project is meant to be a fun and relaxed challenge that we can all work together on.

Please read the rules before merging :) and Happy coding!

## Rules
* Code your word/easter egg in a file under the src/eggs/ folder
* Import it into the src/scripts.js file - here  you can also invoke your function if you need to do so
* Update the src/index.html file with your word and the description (add a table row)
* Make sure that all the previous words still work
* Run ```npm run build```, make a branch with your word and make a PR
* Don't forget to nominate other colleagues

Note: other words to get you inspired can be found in the assets/eggIdeas.json file and you can also update the list with things you want to see made
